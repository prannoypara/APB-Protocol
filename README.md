# APB-Protocol

In this repo, I have explained the working of simple version of APB protocol by taking a simple example. We will initially READ a value from an address location in the slave.
Then we will increment it by 1 and then WRITE it back to slave to the same address location which we accessed earlier.

More expalantion is given in the APB Annotated PDF. Please refer it.
